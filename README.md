# RT-VQM - a CUDA-accelerated implementation of the NTIA VQM Algorithm

This is an implementation of the Video Quality Metric Algorithm by the NTIA.
The algorithm was accelerated by performing runtime critical operations on a GPU (CUDA).

## Requirements

This software has been tested under: Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) with CUDA 6 and 6.5.

Running the software requires a CUDA-capable graphics card (with compute capability 2.1 or higher)

## Build
Requires Cmake 2.8 or higher. To build the software, run:

`cmake ./`

`make`

# Usage

This implementation requires uncompressed, planar YUV420 (I420) files, without any header information. 
According to the recommendation from the VQM authors, video sequences should be between 5 and 15 seconds.
The LIVE and LIVE MOBILE database provide appropriate material for testing, see: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/live_mobile_video.html

To perform a VQM measurement, run:

`./RT-VQM ORIG_PATH PROC_PATH ORIG_WIDTH ORIG_HEIGHT PROC_WIDTH PROC_HEIGHT ORIG_FPS PROC_FPS`

with:

    ORIG_PATH:		Path to the original video (YUV 4:2:0)
    PROC_PATH:		Path to the processed video (YUV 4:2:0)
    ORIG_WIDTH:		Horizontal resolution of the original video 
    ORIG_HEIGHT:		Vertical resolution of the original video 
    PROC_WIDTH:		Horizontal resolution of the processed video 
    PROC_HEIGHT:		Vertical resolution of the processed video 
    ORIG_FPS:		Framerate (fps) of the original video
    PROC_FPS:		Framerate (fps) of the processed video

    (Optional)FORMAT	Output Format:
	    			0: (default) Verbose output
	    			1: CSV output	
	    			2: runtime output (for debugging)
    (Optional)ORIG_NAME	String which will be added to the csv output	
    (Optional)PROC_NAME	Second string which will be added to the csv output	
    (Optional)SCALING	Temporal scaling method for videos with odd framerates:
	    			0: (default) feature duplication
	    			1: frame duplication
	    			2: frame interpolation	
    (Optional)OFFSET	Offset (in frames) where the measurement should be started (default: 0)
    (Optional)LENGTH	Length (in frames) of material which should be analyzed (default: whole video)

An example could be:

`./RT-VQM ./original.yuv ./processed.yuv 1280 720 1280 720 30 30 1 original processed 0 30 600`

Unequal framerates are only supported if they differ by the power of 2 (e.g. 15fps and 30 fps)
Optional parameters are not necessary but if they are applied they have to be placed in the correct order.
